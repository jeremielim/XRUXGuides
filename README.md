While looking through a few XR UX guidelines about where to put things in your 3D scene, I found it difficult to visualize the recommendations that had specific angles and measurements. I'm trying to convert these into a first-person, in-device experience to develop a better feel for them.

### Field of view
### Neck rotation limits 
### Distance and focal points
